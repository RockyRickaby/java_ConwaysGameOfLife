# Conway's Game of Life

The size of the screen is fixed until I come up with a good implementation
that can handle arbitrarily-sized screens.

## Building and running

Run these on the command line and you should be good to go:

```console
$ mvn package
$ java -jar ./target/GmeOfLife-<current version>.jar
```

Alternatively, double clicking the jar file should also run the game.
